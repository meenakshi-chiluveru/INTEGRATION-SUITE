From your handwritten notes, here is a simplified explanation of what an iFlow is in the context of SAP Cloud Platform Integration (CPI) and how it works for sending an email using Gmail:


---

What is an iFlow?

An iFlow (integration flow) is a visual representation of how data moves from one system (sender) to another (receiver)
 using SAP CPI. It defines the sequence and logic of integration steps.

Steps to Create iFlow for Sending Gmail:

1. Create Credentials

Go to Monitor > Integration and APIs > Security Material

Click on Create > User Credentials

Fill in the following:

Name: Gmail (or any name)

Username: Your Gmail ID

Password: App password (not your normal Gmail password)




---

2. Deploy Credentials

After entering the details, click Deploy

These credentials will be used in your mail adapter inside the iFlow



---

3. Create iFlow

Drag and drop the integration process block (start → end)

Add a Mail Adapter to the receiver

Set the mail adapter's connection details:

Address: smtp.gmail.com:587

Proxy Type: Internet

Timeout: 30000 ms

Authentication: PLAIN

Credential Name: The one you created earlier

Encryption: STARTTLS (mandatory)




---

4. Email Content Settings

In the Mail Adapter – Processing tab:

From: Your Gmail

To: Recipient’s Gmail

Subject: e.g., Integration CPI to Gmail

Body: e.g., This is the first email sent from CPI

MIME Type: text/plain



---

5. Trigger Email with Timer

Add a Timer event at the start of the iFlow to automatically trigger the email.

Timer will initiate the message flow at specified intervals.

This is how you create and configure an iFlow in SAP CPI to send emails using Gmail.

Would you like me to convert this into a document or diagram for easy reference?
