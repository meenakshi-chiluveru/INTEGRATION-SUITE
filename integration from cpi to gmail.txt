From your handwritten notes, here is a simplified explanation of what an iFlow is in the context of SAP Cloud Platform Integration (CPI) and how it works for sending an email using Gmail:


---

What is an iFlow?

An iFlow (integration flow) is a visual representation of how data moves from one system (sender) to another (receiver)
 using SAP CPI. It defines the sequence and logic of integration steps.


---

Steps to Create iFlow for Sending Gmail:

1. Create Credentials

Go to Monitor > Integration and APIs > Security Material

Click on Create > User Credentials

Fill in the following:

Name: Gmail (or any name)

Username: Your Gmail ID

Password: App password (not your normal Gmail password)




---

2. Deploy Credentials

After entering the details, click Deploy.

These credentials will be used in your mail adapter inside the iFlow



---

3. Create iFlow

Drag and drop the integration process block (start → end)

Add a Mail Adapter to the receiver

Set the mail adapter's connection details:

Address: smtp.gmail.com:587

Proxy Type: Internet

Timeout: 30000 ms

Authentication: PLAIN

Credential Name: The one you created earlier

Encryption: STARTTLS (mandatory)




---

4. Email Content Settings

In the Mail Adapter – Processing tab:

From: Your Gmail

To: Recipient’s Gmail

Subject: e.g., Integration CPI to Gmail

Body: e.g., This is the first email sent from CPI

MIME Type: text/plain



---

5. Trigger Email with Timer

Add a Timer event at the start of the iFlow to automatically trigger the email.

Timer will initiate the message flow at specified intervals.

This is how you create and configure an iFlow in SAP CPI to send emails using Gmail.

**Understanding iFlows in SAP Cloud Platform Integration (CPI): Sending Emails with Gmail**

In the realm of SAP Cloud Platform Integration (CPI), the concept of an iFlow is crucial. An iFlow represents a specific integration process that facilitates the seamless exchange of data or messages between various systems. In this guide, we will explore the step-by-step process of creating an iFlow to send emails using Gmail.

---

**Step 2: Deploying Credentials**

Once you have gathered the necessary credentials for your Gmail account, proceed by entering those details into the designated fields. After confirming all entries are correct, click on the "Deploy" button. This action ensures that your credentials are securely stored and can be utilized within the Mail Adapter of your iFlow. It’s essential to have this step completed as it lays the foundation for establishing a connection between CPI and your Gmail account.

---

**Step 3: Creating the iFlow**

To begin crafting your iFlow, drag and drop the integration process block, spanning from the start to the end of your workflow. This visual representation is essential for outlining the flow of operations.

Next, incorporate a Mail Adapter as the receiver within this flow. This Mail Adapter serves as the component responsible for dispatching your emails. You'll need to configure the connection details for the Mail Adapter with precision:

- **Address:** Set this to smtp.gmail.com:587, which is the standard SMTP server for Gmail.
- **Proxy Type:** Select "Internet" to allow direct communication.
- **Timeout:** Enter a manageable timeout duration (e.g., 30000 milliseconds) to define how long the system will wait for a response before timing out.
- **Authentication:** Choose "PLAIN" for the authentication method, which suits typical email sending scenarios.
- **Credential Name:** Use the credential name you previously established to connect the adapter securely.
- **Encryption:** Opt for "STARTTLS" as it is mandatory for ensuring that your email communication remains encrypted and secure.

---

**Step 4: Configuring Email Content Settings**

Within the Mail Adapter's "Processing" tab, you will set the parameters for the email you wish to send. Properly configuring these fields is essential for a successful email dispatch:

- **From:** Input your Gmail address here, ensuring that the recipient can identify the sender.
- **To:** Specify the recipient’s Gmail address, making sure it’s accurately entered to reach the intended recipient.
- **Subject:** Craft a clear subject line, such as "Integration CPI to Gmail," to inform the recipient of the email’s purpose.
- **Body:** Compose the message content, for example, "This is the first email sent from CPI," clearly stating your intent.
- **MIME Type:** Set this to "text/plain" to indicate that the email body will contain plain text.

---

**Step 5: Automating Email Delivery with a Timer**

To enhance the functionality of your iFlow, start by incorporating a Timer event right at the beginning of the flow. This element automates the triggering of your email, ensuring it is sent at specified intervals without manual intervention. The Timer will initiate the message flow based on your defined schedule, allowing for efficient and timely communication.

---

In summary, the steps outlined above detail how to create and configure an iFlow within SAP CPI to seamlessly send emails using Gmail. By carefully following these instructions, you can build a reliable integration that enhances your communication capabilities.
