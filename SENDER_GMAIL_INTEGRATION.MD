documenting the setup process for a Postman to Gmail integration using a CPI (Cloud Process Integration) service. Let me explain what's outlined in these notes:
Postman to Gmail Integration Overview
The integration involves three main components: a sender, CPI (Cloud Process Integration), and Gmail. The flow diagram shows data moving from sender → CPI → Gmail.
The credential exchange works as follows:

When connecting CPI to Gmail, Gmail provides credentials to CPI
When connecting sender to CPI, CPI provides credentials to sender

Setup Process

Integration Flow Setup:

Deploy the integration flow
After deployment, go to the monitor tab → Integration Content Management
Find the endpoints option in the dashboard
Copy the endpoint


Creating Authentication Credentials:

Go to instances and subscription page
Click on instances → create
Select "SAP Process Integration Runtime Service instance"
Run as "Integration flow"
Set instance name: "Postman_Gmail"
Create username & password
Create service keys with name like "service_key"


Connecting Postman to CPI:

Uses OAuth 2.0 authentication
In Postman: New → HTTP → GET
Copy/paste the integration flow endpoint
Set Authorization to OAuth 2.0
Configure authorization data in request headers
Set up token details:

Token name: Token
Grant type: client_credentials
Access token URL: paste URL
Client ID & Secret: paste from setup




Request Configuration:

Set Body to "raw" with "text" format
Sample body text: "my name is meenee"
Click send


Data Processing:

Notes mention that HTTPS requests are always synchronous
To get data into Gmail from Postman, Camel Expression is used
Processing path: Body → ${in.body}
Deploy and trigger Postman to send mail



The notes also include a mention that "we need timer" at the top of the first page, suggesting a timing component might be needed for the integration.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
